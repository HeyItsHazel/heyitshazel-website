<p>Jesus fucking hell he's angry again. He's always angry! He's angry at me, he's angry at his job, he's angry at my mom (I didn't even know he still talked to her!) How has this man not died from a heart attack already? I know he's going to yell at me about it. It's always my fault somehow. The TV's not working? My fault. He didn't get a raise? My fault. His girlfriend broke up with him? My fault. I care about him, but how I wish he was rational sometimes</p>

<p>I wish I had a therapist. There are some things I can't even tell Mark, and I tell him a lot of things! So I just end up dumping some of my thoughts here because no one else would listen. I just wish someone would help me</p>

<h2>July 8, 2023</h2>
<p>I'm terrified. I'm fucking terrified. I hate him! I can't stand his face! The sheer fucking audacity he has to do that right after I run away from home! "It'll make you feel better" I SAID NO YOU DIPSHIT! "It'll be like the movies" IM FUCKING CRYING HORNDOG! I was brought home in a police car and got my ass beat and that still somehow manages to not be the worst thing to happen this week!</p>

<p>You selfish fucking bitch. She asks if I can come along and you say "Why do you want to hang out with her? What good is she?" Jesus fuck WHAT GOOD ARE YOU, WHORE?! I'm glad at least she cares about me, because otherwise I'd still want to hang out with you. You're fucking pathetic</p>

<h2>July 25, 2023</h2>
<p>I thought I was better. Fuck, I had another nightmare last night. Will it ever go away? I want him to go away. I wish I never fucking met him! I wish we never got together! If I just pushed him off, it wouldn't have happened. If I didn't listen to his whining, it wouldn't have happened. The things he's called me, the things he said he'd do. I just want to fucking die</p>

<h2>August 4, 2023</h2>
<p>Please let yesterday be a dream, please don't let this actually be my reality, I don't want to deal with this. I don't know shit! I don't know what to do! Who do I talk to about this? I'm fucking alone. How did I not know that would happen?! Jesus, I am stupid</p>
