    <h2>May 5, 2023</h2>
    <p>Heyyyyyy everyone! I decided to code my very own website! This is my first, and I'm very proud of it! I plan to update it more in the future, but I did post some art and poems to start with. (P.S. Elle give me my sweater back, it's my favorite one)</p>

    <p>Happy mother's day! Today was great! Lila and I went to the skate park (I'm very bad at skating lmao) and then Kyle and I went to the movies (Super Mario Bros. It was alright). I also finished a piece I'm very proud of. It was the only photo of my mom that I could find because I think dad burned the rest of them. Anyways, I'll see you all tomorrow! (P.S. Elle I'm serious when I tell you to give me my sweater back)</p>

    <p>Ok, so basically Mark and I went to the library today. We were on the second floor, and while he was picking out a book, I was leaning on the railing. Stupidly, I leaned a little too far back and nearly killed myself when Mark rushed over and yanked my arm, sending me right into him. Everyone was looking at us and I started turning bright red. "You really ought to be more careful, Annabeth," he giggled. So that's the story of how I almost died today</p>

    <h2>July 21, 2023</h2>
    <p>I'm feeling better. Obviously, I'm still going through some things, but otherwise I'm starting to feel like an actual person now lmao</p>
